                    Hub88 is very proud to announce an official shirt partnership with Malta's football club Melita FC. This new partnership between the lightweight integration platform and the club will also see data analytics in football taking a huge leap forward.
                </div>
                <article class="artical-content">
                    Announcing this partnership at the club’s premises on Friday, July 2nd Melita FC president Andrew Naudi said that it is a great step forward for Melita FC in line with the committee’s strategy to take the club to the next level. Through this partnership,
                    Mr Naudi said: "We hope to be able to add value to our technical and social strategies by developing tools that would collect and analyse technical data on the performance of the players through the use of technology, thus providing
                    our technical staff with data that will allow them to gauge performance better, understand and rectify tactical/technical issues and possibly predict possible football related issues”. Director of Hub88, Vladimir Negine, spoke about
                    his wish to give back something to the island and said that although the partnership also includes a substantial shirt sponsorship, the aim was to assist Melita FC and the nursery achieve its goals and to take the club to new heights
                    for the benefit of the players, members, and football in general. Hub88 was established in Malta in 2017 and has offices in Estonia and Malta and forms part of a larger group of brands that are already sponsoring football clubs such
                    as Southampton and Arsenal in the English Premier League. “It is our intention to leverage these connections with HuB88 to provide opportunities for our coaching staff and players to attend trials/training sessions overseas at these
                    big clubs”, Mr Naudi said. “We share the same vision, which is to foster and nurture talent, even through the use of technological advancements and new software solutions.” Mr Naudi also said that the club has achieved a lot over the
                    past years and has great ambitions and objectives for the future. The senior squad’s promotion to the Challenge League was a great milestone for the club and although presents a new challenge, the committee and technical staff are
                    confident that with the current squad of mainly club-grown players, with the addition of a few professional players, including a goal keeper and two high-profile foreigners, the team will rise to the occasion. Mr Adrian Casha, Vice-President
                    of Malta Football Association (MFA), congratulated the club on their promotion and augured the club further success. He said that such a technical partnership is beneficial to the club and falls in line with the Malta Football Association’s
                    strategy to enhance the service offered to the football community through the digitalisation and innovation of processes. Mr Casha said that digitalisation was one of the seven pillars on which the new MFA strategy is based. The recent
                    launch by the MFA of Comet, an integrated application system that aggregates all key business processes and data of football associations, has been a great success, he said.
